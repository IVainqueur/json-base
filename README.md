# **JSONDB**
A simple database-like tool for nodejs using JSON for data storage  
___


```bash
$ npm install jsondb
```


## 1. Features
Generally, the point is that jsondb helps you perform databasa like transactions, currently CRUD. You can go there for sure here we go there this is the best choice.

## 2. Get Started

To get started, first make sure you have the latest stable version of nodejs on your computer. Another thing is that `jsondb` runs only in a node environemt.


**1. Install jsonbd dependecy with npm**  

You have to install jsondb with npm, it's not currently available on other package managers like yarn, etc.
```bash
$ npm install jsondb
```

**2. Initialize jsondb in your project**  

Initialize jsondb in your project. If you have a `src` folder in your project, this will create a `jsondb/database.json` file in the src folder.
```bash
$ npx jsondb --init
```

**3. Create your base schema or just leave it.**  

Initialize jsondb in your project. If you have a `src` folder in your project, this will create a `jsondb/database.json` file in the src folder.  
More about this can be found in the [tutorial](#2-get-started) section and in the [setting up jsondb in your project](#1-setting-up-jsondb-in-a-project) to be exact.

<br>

**4. Perform crud on the schemas as you need it**  

Let's use a simple tutorial on how we can use this `jsondb`. We're going to create a simple app to interact with the `users` model where we can get all the  users, get a particular user with a unique key or get a group of users but not all. The developer can also get a limited number of users if he or she specifies the limit arguement in the get function. We're doing this in [tutorial](#3-a-simple-tutorial) section

4. Upcoming features

#### 1. Setting up jsondb in a project
In this section, we're going to start by creating a nodejs project and add and configure jsondb in it.  

Let's start by installing jsondb from npm package manager 
```
$ npm install jsondb
```

Next, let's initialize jsondb in the nodejs project that we've created

```
$ npx jsondb init
```
On this step, file called `database.json` will be created in the root folder.

*database.json*
```json
{
    "$schema" : "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
    "db" : {
        "users" : [
            {
             "id" : "1" ,
             "username" : "leerob",
             "email" : "lee@rob.io",
             "password" : "robinin"   
            }
        ],
        "posts" : [
            {
                "id" : "1"
                "userId" : "1",
                "photo" : "https://j.co/6235jjgk",
                "caption" : "Look at hom"
            }
        ]
    }
    
}
```

You will need to remove the models in the json database as long as the sample ones may not match  with your purpose.

#### 2. Getting data
In this section, we're going to see how we can get data from our json database.
```ts

    import { getData } from 'jsondb'
    import UserType from './types/usertype'


/*    1. Getting all the users   */

    const allUsers  : UserType[]  =  await getData("users")
    console.log(allUsers)      // prints the list of all users

 /*   2. Getting a user with a unique key   */

    const  userWithId2 = await getData("users", { id : 2 })
    console.log(userWithId2)     // prints the user with a unique id of 2

/*    3. Limiting the number of users to retreive  */
    const firstTenUsers =  await getData("users", {} , 10)
    console.log(firstTenUsers)    // prints the first ten users in the json database 

```


#### 3. Create data
As said before, we'll be creating  a simple crud operation, this means that we already have read checked on our todo checklist as read is the same as getting data. Next we're going to work on creating data.
```ts
    import { createData } from 'jsondb'
    import UserType from './types/usertype'
    
    const newUser : UserType = {
        id : 4 ,
        username : "delba",
        email : "delba@oli.dev",
        password : "8ui4gi82k4kj889n"
    }

    createData("users" ,{ data : newUser }, (err , user) => {
        if(err){
            console.log(err.message)
            process.exit(0)
           }
        console.log(user)
    })

    /*  It's also possible to add an array of users, jsondb api can handle that too */

    const unsavedUsers  : UserType[] = [
        {
            id : 4 ,
            username : "tim",
            email : "tim@neut.com",
            password : "3456yojp%7-055"
        }, 
        {
            id : 5 ,
            username : "palmer",
            email : "palmer@jd.com",
            password : "uhnui0no082kn9"
        }
    ]

    createData("users" , { data : unsavedUsers }  , (err , users) => {
         if(err){
            console.log(err.message)
            process.exit(0)
           }
        console.log(users)
    })
```


#### 4. Update and delete data

Let's combine the update and  the delete  sections into one section as long as they're kinda simple and easy to understand.

Updating data will require a unique identifier of the record we're updating.
```ts
import { updateData } from "jsondb"
import { Request , Response } from "@types/node"
import UserType from "./types/usertype"

app.put("/updateUser/:id" , async (req : Request ,res) => {
    const userId = req.params.id
    const { username } = req.body
    const updatedUser = await updateData("users" , {
        // update user wher the id equals to userId
        where : {
            id : userId
        },
        //  update the user with a new username
        data : {
            username
        }
    })

})
```

Enough for updating data, the next is to learn how to delete some records from the json database. Here, a unique identifier is required.

```ts

import { deleteData } from "jsondb"
import UserType from "./types/usertype"

deleteData("users" , { id : 2 } , (err,data) => {
    if(err){
        console.log("Uncaught error " , err)
        process.exit(0)
    }
    console.log(data)
} )

```

üéâ Congrats! Now we've finished creating our CRUD operations on the users model or collection and I hope now you're able to consume our API and make your life easier.
